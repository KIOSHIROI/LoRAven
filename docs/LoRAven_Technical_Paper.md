## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dynamic Low-Rank Layer Architecture

The core component of LoRAven is the `DynamicLowRankLayer`, which implements runtime-adaptive low-rank matrix factorization:

```
W(t) ≈ U(t) @ S(t) @ V(t)^T
```

Where:
- `W(t) ∈ R^(m×n)`: Target weight matrix at time t
- `U(t) ∈ R^(m×r(t))`: Left factor matrix
- `S(t) ∈ R^(r(t)×r(t))`: Scaling matrix (typically diagonal)
- `V(t) ∈ R^(n×r(t))`: Right factor matrix
- `r(t)`: Dynamic rank at time t

#### 3.1.1 Matrix Multiplication Fusion

Traditional low-rank computation requires three sequential matrix multiplications:

```python
# Traditional approach (3 matrix multiplications)
z1 = torch.matmul(x, V)           # (batch_size, r)
z2 = torch.matmul(z1, S.T)        # (batch_size, r)
y = torch.matmul(z2, U.T)         # (batch_size, out_features)
```

LoRAven introduces matrix fusion optimization:

```python
# Fused approach (1 matrix multiplication + precomputation)
W_fused = V @ (S.T @ U.T)         # Precomputed fusion
y = torch.matmul(x, W_fused)      # Single multiplication
```

This optimization reduces computational complexity from O(3bmr) to O(bmr + r²m + r²n), where b is batch size.

### 3.2 Complexity Scoring and Rank Scheduling

#### 3.2.1 Lightweight Complexity Scorer

The complexity scorer evaluates input difficulty using a lightweight neural network:

```python
class LightweightScorer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, hidden_dim=32):
        super().__init__()
        self.scorer = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(in_features, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.scorer(x.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True))
```

#### 3.2.2 Adaptive Rank Scheduling

The rank scheduler determines optimal rank based on complexity scores and energy constraints:

```
r(t) = RankScheduler(s(x_t), B(t), θ(t))
```

Where:
- `s(x_t)`: Complexity score for input x_t
- `B(t)`: Available energy budget at time t
- `θ(t)`: Historical performance metrics

**Linear Rank Scheduler:**
```
r_base = r_min + s_avg × (r_max - r_min)
r_final = r_base + diversity_bonus + gradient_bonus
```

**Energy-Aware Rank Scheduler:**
```
r_energy = argmax{r : E(r,x) ≤ budget}
r_final = α × r_energy + β × r_complexity
```

### 3.3 Energy-Aware Budget Management

#### 3.3.1 Energy Estimation Model

LoRAven employs a sophisticated energy estimation model considering:

1. **Computational Energy**: `E_compute = FLOPs × E_flop × η_parallel × f_DVFS`
2. **Memory Energy**: `E_memory = Σ(Access_l × E_l × CacheMiss_l)`
3. **Static Energy**: `E_static = P_idle × t_exec`

#### 3.3.2 Budget Allocation Strategy

The budget manager allocates energy resources based on:

- **Layer complexity**: Computational requirements
- **Performance priority**: Task-specific importance
- **Historical efficiency**: Past energy-performance trade-offs

```python
def allocate_budget(self, layer_id, complexity_score, layer_dims, performance_priority=1.0):
    base_budget = self._calculate_base_budget(complexity_score, layer_dims)
    priority_factor = 0.5 + 0.5 * performance_priority
    adjusted_budget = base_budget * priority_factor * self.budget_scaling_factor
    return min(adjusted_budget, self.remaining_budget)
```

### 3.4 Event-Triggered Adaptation

LoRAven implements event-triggered rank adaptation to minimize unnecessary adjustments:

#### 3.4.1 Trigger Conditions

Rank adjustment is triggered when:
1. **Error threshold exceeded**: `|error_current - error_target| > threshold`
2. **Performance degradation**: Significant accuracy drop detected
3. **Energy budget violation**: Consumption exceeds allocated budget

#### 3.4.2 Hebbian-like Learning

The system incorporates Hebbian-like plasticity for adaptive weight updates:

```python
def _hebbian_update(self, x_input, y_output):
    correlation = torch.outer(y_output.mean(0), x_input.mean(0))
    self.U_full.data += self.hebbian_lr * correlation[:, :self.r_curr]
    self.V_full.data += self.hebbian_lr * correlation.T[:, :self.r_curr]
```

            nn.Linear(in_features, 1) for _ in range(num_blocks)
        ])
    
    def forward(self, x):

### 6.1 Convergence Guarantees

LoRAven provides theoretical convergence guarantees under mild conditions:

**Theorem 1 (Convergence)**: Under Lipschitz continuity and bounded gradients, the dynamic rank adaptation converges to a local optimum with probability 1.
